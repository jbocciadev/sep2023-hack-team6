# ABOUT SUBMISSION
## Intro
BusyB is an NGO that strives to help businessess of all sizes and industries in their quest towards a more sustainable world. To this end, we have created our EcoHub/EcoHive, a platform for companies to showcase their ESG initiatives to prospective investors, customers and current or potential employees. Our goal is to create a virtuous circle of friendly competition between companies that pushes them forward in their work.

In our EcoHub/EcoHive, companies can upload the details and images of their initiatives. Once our team has reviewed and approved the content, the company will receive a badge for these that will be displayed on their profile. These badges work in a double way. Fistly, they are a token for companies to collect and boast, both internally in their newsletters, email signatures, etc. and externally in their traditional and social media platforms. Secondly, they are a quick and easy visual cue for anyone seeing them to gauge and assign a value to the contributions that the company is making.
